## Answer Questions

1. What are you building?
    
    I am building a dream-building wep app called eggs. The app will allow me to create *dream* ideas (EGGS) with different types, and allow one to log progress marks for each EGG along the way as they turn their dream into a reality.

2. Who are you building it for? 
    
    I'm building it for myself, and also for anyone else who is looking to fulfill their dreams and change their life. EGGS allows one to focus on the action taken, rather than on what they need to do next. It makes dream building fun and straightforward.
